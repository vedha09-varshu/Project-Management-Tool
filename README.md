*Description* :

This Project Handler is a React-based project management tool that allows users to create and track multiple projects with associated tasks and comments. Each project includes details like name, description, status, and deadline. Tasks are categorized using a Kanban-style board with columns for "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Users can also add comments to each project for better team collaboration. The app includes built-in analytics showing task status counts and total comments per project. All data updates dynamically, ensuring real-time feedback after each action. The backend (not shown here) handles data persistence via REST APIs.
